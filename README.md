Real-Time Speech-to-Text Conversion:

This project implements a real-time speech-to-text conversion system using Python. The system converts spoken words into text using speech recognition technologies and provides a flexible and interactive user experience.

Features:

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Transcribes spoken words to text with minimal delay.
- **Voice Command Recognition**: Trigger specific actions based on voice input (e.g., opening applications, controlling devices).
- **Customizable Recording Duration**: Users can choose the length of the recording.

  ## Technologies Used

- Python
- SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text conversion)
- PyAudio (for audio input)
- Google Speech API or other relevant APIs for speech processing
